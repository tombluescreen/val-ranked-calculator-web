# val-ranked-calculator-web

This is a website to determine if 2-5 Valorant players can play ranked using in-game rules and rank boundaries.

Notes: Entirely client side; no server side stuff (although that could change)

Upgrade using https://dash.valorant-api.com/ to automate the process
 - Getting the current competitive season and act
 - Getting the associated tiers and their icons
Using the Valorant API means that I don't have to maintain this code as much (hopefully).
